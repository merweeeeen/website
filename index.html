          <h3>May 2024 - Aug 2024</h3>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <h5>
            During my internship, my primary task was to support the Backend
            team in creating APIs. This involved analyzing requirements,
            designing and developing endpoints, integrating with databases, and
            ensuring robust functionality through testing and debugging.
            Additionally, I documented the APIs and collaborated closely with
            various team members to ensure seamless integration into the overall
            system. This role enhanced my skills in backend development and team
            collaboration.
            <br />
            <br />
            On top of that, I developed several proof-of-concepts (POCs)
            involving the integration of large language models (LLMs) into our
            system. I worked extensively with graph and vector databases to
            optimize data handling and retrieval. Additionally, I implemented
            retrieval augmented generation features, significantly upgrading and
            enhancing the performance and capabilities of our existing systems.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have also performed penetration testing to ensure the security and
            quality of applications, identifying vulnerabilities and securing
            the system. Integrated automated security testing into CI/CD
            pipelines to streamline the process and enhance continuous
            monitoring.

          <h3>May 2023 - Nov 2023</h3>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <h5>
            Throughout my internship, I actively engaged in the complete
            lifecycle of applications, spanning analysis, design, coding, and
            rigorous testing. Despite limitations in accessing sensitive data, I
            spearheaded the creation of vital Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) for our
            imminent applications, showcasing their potential and functionality.
            <br />
            <br />
            In parallel, I developed internal tools pivotal for our team's
            efficiency. These tools empowered us to validate request signing
            authorizations seamlessly and facilitated the automated validation
            and integration of data from Excel into AWS. Moreover, I played a
            crucial role in coordinating with consumer agencies, contributing
            substantively to the developmental phase of upcoming applications.
            <br />
            <br />
            This experience was a revelation. It exposed me to the effective
            implementation of Agile methodologies in our daily operations,
            profoundly influencing our workflows and optimizing our activities.
            As my inaugural foray into the world of Tech internships, it
            provided me with invaluable insights into the culture and
            operational dynamics of a Tech team. Understanding how the team
            synchronizes its daily activities has been a cornerstone of my
            learning curve in this dynamic field.

          <h3>Oct 2018 - Feb 2019</h3>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <h5>
            During my tenure at OCBC, I thrived in the Wealth Management
            Department, specifically within the Treasury and Investment Team. It
            was an enlightening experience delving into the realm of investment
            products, offering me invaluable insights.
            <br />
            <br />
            My primary responsibilities involved supporting my supervisor in
            daily operations, collaborating closely with the sales department to
            streamline product details and facilitating customer redemption of
            investment reward vouchers. Additionally, I fostered seamless
            communication between the sales team and clients, ensuring smooth
            transactional processes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite my background in Banking &amp Finance, technology wasn't my
            forte. However, I was entrusted by my supervisors to address an old
            VBA code issue alongside a colleague. After rigorous research and
            perseverance, we successfully resolved the problem. This initial
            triumph spurred us to transform the code from a mere data-pulling
            tool into a user-friendly UI within Excel, greatly impressing our
            superiors.
            <br />
            <br />
            This pivotal experience ignited a passion for development within me,
            prompting my decision to enroll in SMU's Information Systems course,
            which I have no regrets enrolling in.

      <div style="padding-bottom: 2vh">
        Ever since young, I love to play sports of any kind. In Primary School,
        I was in my school's Volleyball Club and played in inter-zone
        competitions. I did not have any opportunity to play the sport during my
        secondary school days so I had to forgo the sport, only to play it again
        during University for my inter-faculty games.
        <br />
        <br />
        During my University days, I was in the school's Tchoukball Club and
        also played in inter-school competitions.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also love cycling! I fell in love with this hobby when I was young as
        I used it to transport myself around. When I was in Polytechnic, I got
        my first road bike and I fell in love this hobby even more.
